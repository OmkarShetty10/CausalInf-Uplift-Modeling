# Potential Customer Identification for Direct Marketing using Uplift Modeling with Advanced Machine Learning Techniques

## Project Overview
This project explores the use of **uplift modeling** in direct marketing using the **Criteo uplift dataset**. Uplift modeling helps identify customers who are most likely to respond positively to marketing campaigns, enabling businesses to optimize targeting strategies. The project employs machine learning techniques to predict the causal effect of marketing treatments on customer behavior.

## Motivation
The project was inspired by an interview where causal inference in ad recommendations was discussed. Understanding how machine learning can be used for **causal impact estimation** in marketing became a key focus.

## Dataset
The **Criteo uplift dataset** contains **13 million rows**, where each row represents an individual customer with multiple behavioral attributes. The dataset includes:
- **f0 - f11**: Numeric features representing customer characteristics (anonymized by Criteo).
- **Treatment**: Binary indicator (1 = received marketing, 0 = no marketing).
- **Conversion**: Binary outcome (1 = customer converted, 0 = no conversion).
- **Visit**: Binary indicator (1 = customer visited the website, 0 = no visit).
- **Exposure**: Binary indicator (1 = customer was exposed to the marketing campaign, 0 = not exposed).

## Methodology
Three different uplift modeling approaches were implemented:
1. **Dual Uplift Modeling with Hypercomputing Integration** – A technique designed for handling large datasets efficiently.
2. **eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)** – A widely used gradient boosting algorithm for predictive modeling.
3. **Hybrid Approach** – A combination of **Dual Uplift Model** and **XGBoost**, aimed at increasing accuracy and reliability.

### Uplift Model Framework
Uplift modeling classifies customers into four categories:
- **Sure Things**: Customers who will purchase regardless of the marketing campaign.
- **Lost Causes**: Customers who will not purchase, even with marketing.
- **Sleeping Dogs**: Customers who react negatively to marketing.
- **Persuadables**: Customers who are more likely to purchase after exposure to marketing.

## Implementation
The project was developed using **R programming language**, with parallel computing techniques integrated to handle the large dataset efficiently.

### Key Libraries Used
- `uplift` – For uplift modeling.
- `xgboost` – For gradient boosting.
- `parallel` – For multi-core processing.
- `ggplot2` – For data visualization.

## Results
The evaluation of the models showed that:
- The **Dual Uplift Model with hypercomputing** performed better than traditional approaches on large datasets.
- **XGBoost** was effective in predicting uplift.
- The **hybrid model (Dual Uplift + XGBoost)** provided the best performance in terms of accuracy and reliability.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **causal inference techniques** like uplift modeling can be effectively applied in marketing to optimize customer targeting strategies. The findings highlight the potential of combining machine learning with causal inference methods for better decision-making.

## Next Steps
- Further fine-tuning of model parameters.
- Exploration of deep learning-based uplift models.
- Application of uplift modeling to different domains such as healthcare and finance.
